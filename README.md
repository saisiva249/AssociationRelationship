A company car may be assigned to a manager or not
Aggregation: the car does not depend on the manager for existance, nor does the manager depends on the company car to exists(HAS- A relation) it is uni directional, Manager can have employee but employee cannot have manager. In Aggregation both entities can exists individually which means ending one entity will not affect other entity
